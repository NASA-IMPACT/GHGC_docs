## Welcome to Processing and Verification Reports Documentation

The [U.S. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Center](https://earth.gov/ghgcenter) provides a cloud-based system for exploring and analyzing U.S. government and other curated greenhouse gas datasets.

You can find the processing and verification report for each dataset explaining how each dataset has been handeled carefully.
Dataset **processing and verification report** examples:
