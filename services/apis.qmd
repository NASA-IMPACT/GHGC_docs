Please find a list of publicly available APIs below.

Please note: while some of our services are already very mature, the GHG Center platform is currently in the build-up phase.

* [STAC API](https://ghg.center/api/stac/docs) - Spatio-Temporal Asset Catalog with metadata about our datasets
* [STAC Browser](https://radiantearth.github.io/stac-browser/#/external/ghg.center/api/stac) - convenience interface for browsing the STAC
* [Raster API](https://ghg.center/api/raster/docs) - web map tiles and other protocols to serve raster (image) data
* [Publication API](https://ghg.center/api/publish) - for authorized users to publish new data records


## Open Source

Most of the GHG Center APIs are hosted out of a single project ([ghgc-backend](https://github.com/US-GHG-Center/ghgc-backend)) that combines multiple standalone services.
