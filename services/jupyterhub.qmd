title: JupyterHub
---

The GHG Center promotes the use of JupyterHub environments for interactive data science. JupyterHub enables you to analyze massive archives of Earth science data in the cloud in an interactive environment that alleviates the complexities of managing compute resources (virtual machines, roles and permissions, etc).

Users affiliated with the GHG Center can get access to a dedicated JupyterHub service, provided in collaboration with [2i2c](https://2i2c.org/): [hub.ghg.center](https://hub.ghg.center/). Please find instructions for requesting access below.

If you are a scientist affiliated with NASA projects such as [VEDA](https://nasa-impact.github.io/veda-docs/), [EIS](https://eis.smce.nasa.gov/about.html), and [MAAP](https://ops.maap-project.org), you can also keep using the resources provided by these projects. Through the use of open-source technology, we make sure our services are interoperable and exchangeable.


## Getting access to the GHG Center JupyterHub environment

Access to the GHG Center notebook environment is currently on an as-need basis. If you are a user afficiliated with the GHG Center, you can gain access by following these steps:
