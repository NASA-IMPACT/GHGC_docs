title: "QGIS User Guide Using US GHG Center Datasets" 
---

This step-by-step guide is designed to help users interact with and use GHG datasets with QGIS in JupyterHub. The information in this guide explains how to access, display, and analyze GHG datasets through QGIS.

Accessing GHG Center datasets through QGIS involves using the STAC API browser plugin. This plugin gives access to datasets directly from the GHG Center and displays them in QGIS. This guide will show you a few examples of how to interact with a dataset within QGIS, including how to perform simple raster analysis and map graphic creation.

Let's get started.

## Step-by-step

1. Go to the [US GHG Center homepage](https://earth.gov/ghgcenter) and click “Hub” in the navigation bar.

2. If you are new to using JupyterHub to access GHG Center datasets, you will need to [request access](https://us-ghg-center.github.io/ghgc-docs/services/jupyterhub.html). Otherwise, access JupyterHub using your login information. Scroll down and select “QGIS on Linux Desktop”, then click “start” at the bottom of the page. QGIS should open using a Linux Desktop.

3. Next, go to the Plugins menu in the top navigation bar and select “STAC API Browser Plugin”.

4. With the STAC API Browser Plugin open, select the connection labeled “US GHG Center”. If this option does not appear in the menu, complete the next step, then select the connection. If you do see the “US GHG Center” option, go to Step 6.

5. To add “US GHG Center” as a connection, click “New” to create a new connection for the plugin. In the “Create a New Connection” window, type “US GHG Center” in the “Name” field. In the URL field, enter https://earth.gov/ghgcenter/api/stac/, click “Test connection”, then click OK.

6. In the STAC API Browser window, select “US GHG Center” in the connections drop-down menu, then click “Fetch collections.” Now the available datasets will be displayed.

7. Select a dataset, and it will be displayed in QGIS for you to work with. For this example, we will use “U.S. Gridded Anthropogenic Methane Emissions Inventory v2 Express Extension”.

8. The available options show U.S. Gridded Anthropogenic Methane Emissions by year from 2012-2020. For this example, we will use the 2020 dataset.

9. Click “View Assets” and choose a tiff file to add the dataset to QGIS. For this example, we will select “Total Agriculture (annual)”. Next, click the “Select to add as a layer” checkbox for the chosen dataset.

10. Data should now be displayed in QGIS. Now you can use the data to conduct analysis and create graphics.

11. First, we will conduct some simple statistical analysis on the dataset. Navigate to the toolbox menu, represented by a gear icon and located along the main navigation bar, and search for “raster layer statistics” under the “Raster analysis” section. Then, insert our GHG Center dataset as the input file and click run. This raster analysis tool calculates several statistics including the mean, standard deviation, and the sum of squares, using our dataset.

12. Right click on the data display and select “Properties.” Then, select “Symbology”. As you can see, the render type is currently set to “singleband gray”. This means our raster data is being displayed in grayscale. We want to change the symbology so that our data is easier to interpret. Change the render type from “singleband gray” to “singleband pseudocolor”. This will allow us to display our data as a color gradient. For the color ramp, we will use “reds.” You can also change the mode in which the gradient bands are divided. For this example, we will use “equal interval” with band cut offs rounded to whole numbers. Standard deviation is also an option. Feel free to experiment, but keep in mind that different display methods will influence how the audience interprets the data.

13. You can enhance the data visualization by adding shapefiles. In this case, we will add borders for the United States using a shapefile from ArcGIS Hub. Click Download, then scroll down to the shapefile and click the Download button.

14. Next, In QGIS, navigate to “Layer”, then to “Add Layer”, then to “Add Vector Layer” from the dropdown menu. Navigate to your recently downloaded shapefile and add it. It should now be visible in QGIS.

15. Right now, our shapefile covers our raster dataset. To fix this but keep the state borders visible, right click on the shapefile, then select the symbology tab. Change “Fill color” to transparent.

16. Now we can create a map graphic. In the top menu bar, navigate to “Project”, then to “New Print Layout”. Give the print layout a title. We will be naming our print layout “US Agricultural Emissions 2020”.

17. Next, we will add the map to the layout using the “add map” tool on the left hand toolbar. From this toolbar, we can add all standard cartographic elements. Make sure to include a title, scale bar, legend, north arrow, and metadata, which should include data sources and map projection.
