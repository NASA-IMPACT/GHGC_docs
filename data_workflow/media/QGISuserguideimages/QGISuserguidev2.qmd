---

This step-by-step guide is designed to help users interact with and use GHG datasets with QGIS in JupyterHub. The information in this guide explains how to access, display, and analyze GHG datasets through QGIS.

Accessing GHG Center datasets through QGIS involves using the STAC API browser plugin. This plugin gives access to datasets directly from the GHG Center and displays them in QGIS. This guide will show you a few examples of how to interact with a dataset within QGIS, including how to perform simple raster analysis and map graphic creation.
