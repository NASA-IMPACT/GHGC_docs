title: GRA²PES Greenhouse Gas and Air Quality Species
description: "The Greenhouse gas And Air Pollutants Emissions System (GRA²PES) dataset at the GHG Center is an aggregated, regridded, monthly high-resolution (0.036 x 0.036°) data product with emissions of both greenhouse gases and air pollutants developed in a consistent framework. The dataset contains emissions over the contiguous United States covering major anthropogenic sectors, including energy, industrial fuel combustion and processes, commercial and residential combustion, oil and gas production, on-road and off-road transportation, etc. (see Table 2 in the Scientific Details section below for a full sector list). Fossil fuel CO₂ (ffCO₂) emissions are developed along with those of air pollutants including CO, NOₓ, SO₂, and PM₂.₅ with consistency in spatial and temporal distributions. Emissions by sectors are reported as column totals in units of metric tons per km² per month. Spatial-temporal surrogates are developed to distribute CO₂ emissions to grid cells to keep consistency between greenhouse gases and air quality species. The current version of GRA²PES is for 2021. Long-term emissions and more greenhouse gas species (e.g., methane) are under development and will be added in the future."
