title: TM5-4DVar Isotopic CH₄ Inverse Fluxes
description: "The Greenhouse gas And Air Pollutants Emissions System (GRA2PES) dataset at the GHG Center is an aggregated, regridded, monthly high-resolution (0.036 x 0.036°) data product with emissions of both greenhouse gases and air pollutants developed in a consistent framework. The dataset contains emissions over the contiguous United States covering major anthropogenic sectors, including energy, industrial fuel combustion and processes, commercial and residential combustion, oil and gas production, on-road and off-road transportation, etc. (see Table 1 in the Scientific Details section below for a full sector list). Fossil fuel CO2 (ffCO2) emissions are developed along with those of air pollutants including CO, NOx, SOx, and PM2.5 with consistency in spatial and temporal distributions. Emissions by sectors are grouped into point and area sources, reported as column totals in units of metric tons per km2 per month. Spatial-temporal surrogates are developed to distribute CO2 emissions to grid cells to keep consistency between greenhouse gases and air quality species. The current version of GRA2PES is for 2021. Long-term emissions and more greenhouse gas species (e.g., methane) are under development and will be added in the future."
