title: "QGIS User Guide Using US GHG Center Datasets" 
---

This step-by-step guide is designed to help users interact and use GHG datasets using QGIS in the Hub.

## Step-by-step
1. Navigate to the US GHG Center webpage and press “Hub” on the top banner.

2. Access JupyterHub using your login information. Scroll down and select “QGIS on Linux Desktop.” Then press start.

3. QGIS should open using a Linux Desktop

4. Next select plugins and find the “STAC API Browser Plugin.” Select and open it.

5. Next with the STAC API Browser Plugin open, select the connection labeled “US GHG Center."

6. If US GHG Center is not one of the listed connections, we need to add it. This will allow the plugin to fetch datasets from the US GHG Center. To do this select "new connection." In the new connection window under name type “US GHG Center.” For the url use https://earth.gov/ghgcenter/api/stac/ and then click “Test connection.” Then press ok.

7. Next press “Fetch Connections.” Now the available datasets will be shown.

8. Select a dataset and it will be displayed in QGIS for you to work with. For this example, we will be using “U.S. Gridded Anthropogenic Methane Emissions Inventory v2 Express Extension."

9. The available options show U.S. Gridded Anthropogenic Methane Emissions by year from 2012-2020. I will be selecting the 2020 dataset.

10. Click “View Assets” and choose a tiff to add the dataset to QGIS. For this example, we will be selecting “Total Agriculture (annual)” Then click “add selected assets as layers.”

11. Data should now be displayed in QGIS. Now to conduct some analysis and create an informative graphic.

12. Right click over the data and select “properties.” Then select “Symbology.” As you can see the render type is currently set to “singleband gray.” This means our raster data is being displayed in grayscale. We would like to change that.

13. Before changing the symbology, we are going to conduct some simple statistical analysis on the dataset. Navigate to the toolbox tab and search for “raster layer statistics” under the “Raster Analysis” section. Then input the tiff file and click run.

14. This raster analysis tool calculates several statistics including the mean, standard deviation, and the sum of squares, using our dataset.

15. Next, we want to change the symbology so that our data is easier to interpret. As in Step 12 open the symbology for our dataset. Change the render type from “singleband gray” to “singleband psuedocolor.” This will allow us to display our data as a color gradient. For the color ramp we will be using “reds.” You can also change the mode in which the gradient is broken down. For this example, we will be using “equal interval” with band cut off’s rounded to whole numbers. Feel free to experiment but keep in mind that different display methods will influence how the audience interprets the data.

16. Great, now our data is more intuitive to understand. But we could still use something to better contextualize our data. In this case we will be adding borders for the United States. We will be downloading and inserting a shapefile from [ArcGIS Hub.](https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/1b02c87f62d24508970dc1a6df80c98e/explore) Download the shapefile. Then in QGIS navigate to “Layer”, then to “Add Layer,” then to “Add Vector Layer” from the dropdown menu. Navigate to your recently downloaded shapefile and add it. It should now be visible in QGIS.

17. Right now, our states shapefile covers our raster dataset. To fix this but keep the state borders visible, right click the shapefile navigate to the symbology page just as in Step 12. Then change "fill color" to transparent.

18. Looks good! Now we can create our map graphic to inform readers. Navigate to “Project” then to “New Print Layout” and give it a title. We will be naming our print layout "US Agricultural Emissions 2020."

19. Next we will add the map to the layoout using the “add map” tool on the lefthand toolbar.

20. From the lefthand toolbar on this page we are able to add all standard cartographic elements. Make sure to include a title, a scale bar, a legend, a north arrow and metadata, which should include data sources and map projection.

Congragulations, you have successfully interacted with US GHG Center datasets through QGIS in JupyterHub!
