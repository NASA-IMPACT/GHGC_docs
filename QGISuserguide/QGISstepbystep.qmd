6. If US GHG Center is not one of the listed connections, we need to add it. This will allow the plugin to fetch datasets from the US GHG Center. To do this select "new connection." In the new connection window under name type “US GHG Center.” For the url use https://earth.gov/ghgcenter/api/stac/ and then click “Test connection.” Then press ok.
