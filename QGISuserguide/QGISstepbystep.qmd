title: "QGIS User Guide Using GHG Datasets" 
---

This step-by-step guide is designed to help users interact and use GHG datasets using QGIS in the Hub.

## Step-by-step
1. Navigate to the US GHG Center webpage and press “Hub” on the top banner.

2. Access JupyterHub using your login information. Scroll down and select “QGIS on Linux Desktop.” Then press start.

3. QGIS should open using a Linux Desktop

4. Next select plugins and find the “STAC API Browser Plugin.” Select and open it.

5. Next with the STAC API Browser Plugin open, select the connection labeled “US GHG Center."

6. If US GHG Center is not one of the listed connections, we need to add it. This will allow the plugin to fetch datasets from the US GHG Center. To do this select "new connection." In the new connection window under name type “US GHG Center.” For the url use https://earth.gov/ghgcenter/api/stac/ and then click “Test connection.” Then press ok.

7. Next press “Fetch Connections.” Now the available datasets will be shown.

8. Select a dataset and it will be displayed in QGIS for you to work with. For this example, we will be using “U.S. Gridded Anthropogenic Methane Emissions Inventory v2 Express Extension."

9. The available options show U.S. Gridded Anthropogenic Methane Emissions by year from 2012-2020. I will be selecting the 2020 dataset.

10. Click “View Assets” and choose a tiff to add the dataset to QGIS. For this example, we will be selecting “Total Agriculture (annual)” Then click “add selected assets as layers.”

11. Data should now be displayed in QGIS. Now to conduct some analysis and create an informative graphic.

12. Right click over the data and select “properties.” Then select “Symbology.” As you can see the render type is currently set to “singleband gray.” This means our raster data is being displayed in grayscale. We would like to change that.

13. Before changing the symbology, we are going to conduct some simple statistical analysis on the dataset. Navigate to the toolbox tab and search for “raster layer statistics” under the “Raster Analysis” section. Then input the tiff file and click run.
