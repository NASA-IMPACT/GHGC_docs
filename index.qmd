## Welcome {#welcome}

The [U.S. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Center](https://ghg.center) provides a cloud-based system for exploring and analyzing U.S. government and other curated greenhouse gas datasets.

On this site, you can find the technical documentation of the services the center provides, how to load the datasets, and how the datasets were transformed from their source formats (eg. NetCDF, HDF, etc.) into cloud-optimized formats that enable efficient data access and visualization.


## Contents

1. **Services** provided for accessing and analyzing the GHG Center datasets, such as a [JupyterHub](services/jupyterhub.qmd) environment for interactive computing.
2. Dataset **usage** examples, e.g. for the [LPJ-wsl modelled Wetland Methane Emissions](user_data_notebooks/lpjwsl-wetlandch4-grid-v1_User_Notebook.ipynb) dataset, showing how to load the dataset in Python, for example in [JupyterHub](services/jupyterhub.qmd).
3. Dataset **transformation** scripts, e.g. for the [CASA-GFED3 Land Carbon Flux](cog_transformation/casagfed-carbonflux-monthgrid-v3.ipynb) dataset.
4. Data **processing and verification** reports, e.g. for the [CEOS CH4 budget yearly](processing_and_verification_reports/ceos-ch4budget-yeargrid-v1_Processing and Verification Report.qmd) dataset.
